# Swiss Travel Time Calculations

A GIS-based analysis for calculating car travel times between all Swiss municipalities and postal code zones using network centrality algorithms and openrouteservice.

## Overview

This project calculates approximately 18 million individual travel time 
computations between Swiss municipalities (\~2,000) and postal code zones 
(\~4,000) to quantify the concept of "local" for research on effects of local 
business mergers.

## Methodology

Uses openrouteservice hosted locally via Docker to overcome API limitations.
Python scripts handle API requests and data processing.

Calculates the most central point within each zone's road network, by 
calculating the highest betweenness centrality value for each network. 
Ensures start/end points are always on actual roads. Better represents 
perceived community centers than geometric centroids.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project is provided by the Federal Office of Topography swisstopo.

swissTLM3D dataset with the following road categories:

-   Highways (Autobahn, Autostrasse) Various road widths (3m, 4m, 6m, 8m, 10m roads) 
-   Access roads (Einfahrt, Ausfahrt, Zufahrt, Dienstzufahrt) 
-   Connections and service areas

## Data Processing

Preprocessing: 
-   RStudio
  -   Network Analysis: Betweenness centrality calculation for each municipality/postal zone.
  -   Exclusions: Unreachable areas, lakes, and Liechtenstein postal zones.
Routing: Local openrouteservice instance via Docker, requested through Python.
